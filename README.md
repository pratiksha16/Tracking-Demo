Tracking-project
TMS (Tracking Manager System) is about finding the location of your friend using Google Map 
API. You should be able to track the location, keep the record of the location, time, date. 
Depending upon your ability, you can also save coordinates of the location. Your project should 
also have a backup system, which allow users to export the data in PDF, word and excel format. 
The code should be written in your own, but you can seek internet and other sources. Please, be 
aware of the integrity of the code. You should have a database system for backup and real-time 
data. You must have User Login system, real-time database, real-time system working using 
Google Map and a backup system in your project.
